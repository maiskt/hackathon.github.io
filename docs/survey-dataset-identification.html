<p>Any given survey dataset can be identified using together the following 3 variables: SBJNUM, COUNTRY, and YEAR.</p>
<div id="sbjnum" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> SBJNUM</h2>
<p>This is the identification variable that uniquely identifies each respondent within an individual survey dataset. It is worth noting that two respondents from two different survey datasets can have the same SBJNUM value. For this reason, it is important to use variables SBJNUM, COUNTRY, and YEAR at the same time when using multiple survey datasets.</p>

The maximum radius for displacement is within 2km for an urban area and 5km for a rural area, with a 1/100 chance of the maximum rural radius being 10km.
