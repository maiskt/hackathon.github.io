# Informal Financial Groups

## BELONG_INFML
A derived binary variable, BELONG_INFML represents the respondent's participation in informal societies or group saving schemes. The definition of "informal" varies by sophistication of village-level services, but the common institutions that qualify include:

* Cooperatives
* Village-level saving and lending group
* Informal loan clubs or rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs, with [many regional names](http://www.gdrc.org/icm/rosca/rosca-names.html))

If the respondent is part of one or more IFGs, BELONG_INFML = 1. Otherwise it is 0.

## R_INFML
If the respondent belongs to one or more IFGs, R_INFML asks for the most important reason from the following:

Value | Reason
----- | -------
    1 | To have a lump sum to use when itâ€™s your turn
    2 | To help when there is a death in the family or any other emergency
    3 | To have access to loans or credit when needed
    4 | Easier to use or more accessible than other financial service providers

Between 12 and 15 options were originally given for this question. In 2017, respondents were asked about the importance of these factors on a Likert scale from 1, least important, to 5, most important. Because of no direct way to convert question formats and preserve information, the responses were not included in this compiled dataset.

## R_NOINFML
If the respondent does _not_ belong in an IFG, R_NOINFML asks for the most important reason from the following:

**What is the most important reason for your decision not to join informal societies or group saving schemes?**

Value | Reason
----- | -------
1     | Don't have any money left for savings
2     | Don't know about them
3     | Don't trust them/people steal your money
4     | Don't need any service from them/their services are better served by other financial service providers
