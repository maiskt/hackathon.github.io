["identifying-characteristics.html", "Section 1 Identifying Characteristics 1.1 SBJNUM 1.2 COUNTRY 1.3 YEAR 1.4 UR 1.5 CLUSTER 1.6 ANON_LAT, ANON_LONG", " Section 1 Identifying Characteristics The primary identification variables used for organizing and filtering the datasets. 1.1 SBJNUM The original ID for individual respondants. There is no standard length across datasets, and two different responses across datasets may share the same Subject Number. When examining single observations, make sure to filter by SBJNUM, COUNTRY, and YEAR at the same time. 1.2 COUNTRY The country where the collection program took place. Countries include: Bangladesh India Indonesia Kenya Nigeria Pakistan Tanzania Uganda 1.3 YEAR The year when the collection program took place. Time frames range from 2013 to 2018. Indonesia only has data from 2014 to 2016. 1.4 UR This variable categorizes the respondent as living in an urban or rural area. While exact boundaries vary by country, access to city resources is the primary factor considered. Urban Rural 1 2 1.5 CLUSTER A geographic grouping of respondents, typically representing a single area where interviews were taken. Clusters with names have been converted to numbers. Due to inadequate data, clusters for Nigeria in 2013 are unavailable. 1.6 ANON_LAT, ANON_LONG Anonymized latitude and longitude of the approximate housheold location. The method of anonymization is very similar to the one practiced by the Demographic Health Surveys project. All respondents within a cluster share the same coordinates. Cluster centers were initially calculated by averaging all longitudes and latitudes, then displacing the point randomly within a radius inside the second-level geographic area (e.g. counties). The maximum radius for displacement is within 2km for an urban area and 5km for a rural area, with a 1/100 chance of the maximum rural radius being 10km. This method is intended to preserve location anonymity while still being usable for basic spatial analysis purposes. Due to inadequate data, 2013 data for Nigeria and Tanzania are unavailable. "],

The definition varies by sophistication of village-level services, but the common institutions that qualify include: Cooperatives Village-level saving and lending group Informal loan clubs or rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs, with many regional names) 9.1.1 Bangladesh Only 2016 and 2017 data are available. ### Kenya Only 2015-2017 data are available. 9.1.2 India Only 2015-2017 data are available. 9.1.3 Indonesia Only 2015 and 2016 data are available. 9.1.4 Nigeria Only 2015-2017 data are available. 9.1.5 Pakistan No data is available. 9.1.6 Tanzania Only 2015-2017 data are available. 9.1.7 Uganda Only 2015-2017 data are available. 9.1.8 R_INFML If the respondent confirmed their past or present participation in an informal financial group, their main reason was asked from the following options: Value Reason 1 To have a lump sum to use when it’s your turn 2 To help when there is a death in the family or any other emergency 3 To have access to loans or credit when needed 4 Easier to use or more accessible than other financial service providers In 2017, responses lie on a Likert scale from 1, least important, to 5, most important, for these four columns.

If their response was one of the four, it was categorized as a “5” (most important) ### Pakistan ### Tanzania 2013: None ### Uganda 2013: None 9.2 R_NOINFML These questions ask the importance of each reason for not being a part of an IFG.

Variable Reason IFG2_1 Don’t have any money left for savings IFG2_2 Don’t know about them IFG2_3 Don’t trust them/people steal your money IFG2_4 Don’t need any service from them/their services are better served by other financial service providers 9.2.1 Bangladesh In 2013, there was no option for “Don’t know about them”. ### Kenya ### India 2015: IFI25 2016: IFI24 ### Indonesia ### Nigeria 2013:IFI3 For 2016, the respondent was to choose their most important reason from ten options, including a custom “other” option.

Do you receive the following services through any of the informal societies or group saving schemes that you personally belong to? Variable Reason IFG3_1 Welfare/clan group - we help each other out for things like funerals IFG3_2 We receive loan/credit IFG3_3 We collect money and give to each member a lump sum (pot) or gift in turn IFG3_4 We save and lend money to members and/or non-members to be repaid with interest IFG3_5 We periodically distribute all monies held by the group to its members IFG3_6 We save together and put the money in an account IFG3_7 We make other kinds of investments as a group (e.g., property, business) IFG3_8 We invest in the stock market as a group 9.2.3 Bangladesh 2013: IFI5 ### Kenya ### India ### Indonesia ### Nigeria ### Pakistan ### Tanzania ### Uganda 2013: None "],
