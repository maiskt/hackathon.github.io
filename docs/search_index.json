The definition varies by sophistication of village-level services, but the common institutions that qualify include: Cooperatives Village-level saving and lending group Informal loan clubs or rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs, with many regional names) 6.3 IFG2 These questions ask the importance of each reason for not being a part of an IFG. Responses lie on a Likert scale from 1, least important, to 5, most important for these four columns: How important or unimportant is the following reason for your decision not to join informal societies or group saving schemes? Variable Reason IFG2_1 Don’t have any money left for savings IFG2_2 Don’t know about them IFG2_3 Don’t trust them/people steal your money IFG2_4 Don’t need any service from them/their services are better served by other financial service providers 6.3.1 Bangladesh 6.3.2 Kenya 6.3.3 India 6.3.4 Indonesia 6.3.5 Nigeria 6.3.6 Pakistan 6.3.7 Tanzania 6.3.8 Uganda For 2016, the respondent was to choose their most important reason from ten options, including a custom “other” option. To adjust, the reason given (if one of the four we account for)was coded as a “5” and all others were 6.3.9 IFG3 This subsection asks the respondent, if a member of an IFG, what services they are provided. Do you receive the following services through any of the informal societies or group saving schemes that you personally belong to? | Variable Reason IFG3_1 Welfare/clan group - we help each other out for things like funerals IFG3_2 We receive loan/credit IFG3_3 We collect money and give to each member a lump sum (pot) or gift in turn IFG3_4 We save and lend money to members and/or non-members to be repaid with interest IFG3_5 We periodically distribute all monies held by the group to its members IFG3_6 We save together and put the money in an account IFG3_7 We make other kinds of investments as a group (e.g., property, business) IFG3_8 We invest in the stock market as a group 6.3.10 IFG4 6.3.10.1 Nigeria Nigeria 2016 only asked which reason for informal group financing was most important out of a list of 15, with an “other” option to describe.
