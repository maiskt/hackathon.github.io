["survey-dataset-identification.html", "Section 1 Survey Dataset Identification 1.1 SBJNUM 1.2 COUNTRY 1.3 YEAR", " Section 1 Survey Dataset Identification Any given survey dataset can be identified using together the following 3 variables. 1.1 SBJNUM This is the identification variable that uniquely identifies each respondent within an individual survey dataset. It is worth noting that two respondents from two different survey datasets can have the same SBJNUM value. For this reason, it is important to use variables SBJNUM, COUNTRY, and YEAR at the same time when using multiple survey datasets. 1.2 COUNTRY This is the name of the country survey, i.e, where data collection took place. Countries include: Bangladesh India Indonesia Kenya Nigeria Pakistan Tanzania Uganda 1.3 YEAR This is the year in which data collection place. It runs from 2013 to 2018, except for Indonesia where it ranges from 2014 to 2016. Other variables Each individual survey dataset also includes the following variables "],
["ur.html", "Section 2 UR 2.1 CLUSTER 2.2 ANON_LAT, ANON_LONG", " Section 2 UR Type of place residence where the respondent resides as either urban or rural. Urban | Rural —| — 1 | 2 2.1 CLUSTER The cluster number is the number identifiying the sample point as used during the filedwork. Clusters with names have been converted to numbers. Due to inadequate data, clusters for Nigeria in 2013 are unavailable. 2.2 ANON_LAT, ANON_LONG Anonymized latitude and longitude of the approximate housheold location. The method of anonymization is very similar to the one practiced by the Demographic Health Surveys project. All respondents within a cluster share the same coordinates. Cluster centers were initially calculated by averaging all longitudes and latitudes, then displacing the point randomly within a radius inside the second-level geographic area (e.g. counties). The maximum radius for displacement is within 2km for an urban area and 5km for a rural area, with a 1/100 chance of the maximum rural radius being 10km. This method is intended to preserve location anonymity while still being usable for basic spatial analysis purposes. Due to inadequate data, 2013 GPS data for Nigeria and Tanzania are unavailable.

The definition varies by sophistication of village-level services, but the common institutions that qualify include: Cooperatives Village-level saving and lending group Informal loan clubs or rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs, with many regional names) 10.1.1 Bangladesh Only 2016 and 2017 data are available. 10.1.2 Kenya Only 2015-2017 data are available. 10.1.3 India Only 2015-2017 data are available. 10.1.4 Indonesia Only 2015 and 2016 data are available. 10.1.5 Nigeria Only 2015-2017 data are available. 10.1.6 Pakistan No data is available. 10.1.7 Tanzania Only 2015-2017 data are available. 10.1.8 Uganda Only 2015-2017 data are available. 10.1.9 R_INFML If the respondent confirmed their past or present participation in an informal financial group, their main reason was asked from the following options: Value Reason 1 To have a lump sum to use when it’s your turn 2 To help when there is a death in the family or any other emergency 3 To have access to loans or credit when needed 4 Easier to use or more accessible than other financial service providers In 2017, responses lie on a Likert scale from 1, least important, to 5, most important, for these four columns.
