It is worth noting that two respondents from two different survey datasets can have the same SBJNUM value. For this reason, it is important to use variables SBJNUM, COUNTRY, and YEAR at the same time when using multiple survey datasets. 1.2 COUNTRY This is the name of the country where the survey was conducted. the following countries were surveyed: Bangladesh India Indonesia Kenya Nigeria Pakistan Tanzania Uganda 1.3 YEAR This is the year in which data collection place. It runs from 2013 to 2018, except for Indonesia where it ranges from 2014 to 2016. Other variables Each individual survey dataset also includes the following variables: 1.4 UR Type of place residence where the respondent resides as either urban or rural. 1.5 CLUSTER The cluster number is the number identifiying the sample point as used during the filedwork. Clusters with names have been converted to numbers. Due to inadequate data, cluster numbers for the 2013 Nigeria survey are not available. 1.6 ANON_LAT, ANON_LONG Anonymized latitude and longitude of the approximate household location. The method of anonymization is very similar to the one practiced by the Demographic Health Surveys project. All respondents within a cluster share the same coordinates. Cluster centers were initially calculated by averaging all longitudes and latitudes, then displacing the point randomly within a radius inside the second-level geographic area (e.g. counties). The maximum radius for displacement is within 2km for an urban area and 5km for a rural area, with a 1/100 chance of the maximum rural radius being 10km. This method is intended to preserve location anonymity while still being usable for basic spatial analysis purposes. Due to inadequate data, 2013 GPS data for Nigeria and Tanzania are unavailable.

["informal-financial-groups.html", "Section 9 Informal Financial Groups 9.1 BELONG_INFML 9.2 R_INFML 9.3 R_NOINFML 9.4 INFML_SERVICE", " Section 9 Informal Financial Groups The following variables were coded in numeric order of which they were asked. 9.1 BELONG_INFML A derived binary variable, BELONG_INFML represents the respondent’s current or formal participation in an informal financial group (IFG). The definition varies by sophistication of village-level services, but the common institutions that qualify include: Cooperatives Village-level saving and lending group Informal loan clubs or rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs, with many regional names) 9.1.1 Bangladesh Only 2016 and 2017 data are available. 9.1.2 Kenya Only 2015-2017 data are available. 9.1.3 India Only 2015-2017 data are available. 9.1.4 Indonesia Only 2015 and 2016 data are available. 9.1.5 Nigeria Only 2015-2017 data are available. 9.1.6 Pakistan No data is available. 9.1.7 Tanzania Only 2015-2017 data are available. 9.1.8 Uganda Only 2015-2017 data are available. 9.2 R_INFML If the respondent confirmed their past or present participation in an informal financial group, their main reason was asked from the following options: Value Reason 1 To have a lump sum to use when it’s your turn 2 To help when there is a death in the family or any other emergency 3 To have access to loans or credit when needed 4 Easier to use or more accessible than other financial service providers Between 12 and 15 options were originally given for this question. In 2017, respondents were asked about the importance of these factors on a Likert scale from 1, least important, to 5, most important. Because of no direct way to convert question formats and preserve information, the responses were not included in this compiled dataset. 9.3 R_NOINFML These questions ask the importance of each reason for not being a part of an IFG. What is the most important reason for your decision not to join informal societies or group saving schemes? Value Reason 1 Don’t have any money left for savings 2 Don’t know about them 3 Don’t trust them/people steal your money 4 Don’t need any service from them/their services are better served by other financial service providers 9.3.1 Bangladesh In 2013, there was no option for “Don’t know about them”. ### Kenya ### India ### Indonesia ### Nigeria In 2013, there was no option for “Don’t know about them”. ### Pakistan ### Tanzania ### Uganda 9.4 INFML_SERVICE This subsection asks the respondent, if a member of an IFG, what services they are provided. These questions are all binary, with 1 meaning “Yes” and 2 meaning “No”. Do you receive the following services through any of the informal societies or group saving schemes that you personally belong to? Variable Reason INFML_SERVICE_1 Welfare/clan group - we help each other out for things like funerals INFML_SERVICE_2 We receive loan/credit INFML_SERVICE_3 We collect money and give to each member a lump sum (pot) or gift in turn INFML_SERVICE_4 We save and lend money to members and/or non-members to be repaid with interest INFML_SERVICE_5 We periodically distribute all monies held by the group to its members INFML_SERVICE_6 We save together and put the money in an account INFML_SERVICE_7 We make other kinds of investments as a group (e.g., property, business) INFML_SERVICE_8 We invest in the stock market as a group Number of service options asked, by country and year country | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 —- Bangladesh | 0 | 5 | 8 India | 0 | 9 | 8 Indonesia | 0 | 9 | 0 Kenya | 7 | 8 | 8 Nigeria | 7 | 8 | 8 Pakistan | 0 | 7 | 7 Tanzania | 7 | 8 | 8 Uganda | 7 | 8 | 8 9.4.1 Bangladesh In 2016, serivces 1 and 5 were not asked about. 9.4.2 Kenya In 2015, service 2 was not asked about. 9.4.3 Nigeria In 2015, service 2 was not asked about. 9.4.4 Pakistan In 2015, this question was not asked. In 2016 and 2017, only services 1, 3, 4, and 6 were asked. Other, more specific ROSCA-related questions were asked. 9.4.5 Tanzania In 2015, service 2 was not asked about. 9.4.6 Uganda In 2015, service 2 was not asked about. "]
