It is worth noting that two respondents from two different survey datasets can have the same SBJNUM value. For this reason, it is important to use variables SBJNUM, COUNTRY, and YEAR at the same time when using multiple survey datasets. 1.2 COUNTRY This is the name of the country where the survey was conducted. the following countries were surveyed: Bangladesh India Indonesia Kenya Nigeria Pakistan Tanzania Uganda 1.3 YEAR This is the year in which data collection place. It runs from 2013 to 2018, except for Indonesia where it ranges from 2014 to 2016. Other variables Each individual survey dataset also includes the following variables: 1.4 WEIGTH This is the survey weight to use in analyses. Each survey dataset contains its own set of weights. 1.5 UR Type of place residence where the respondent resides as either urban or rural. 1.6 CLUSTER The cluster number is the number identifiying the sample point as used during the filedwork. Clusters with names have been converted to numbers. Due to inadequate data, cluster numbers for the 2013 Nigeria survey are not available. 1.7 ANON_LAT, ANON_LONG Anonymized latitude and longitude of the approximate household location. The method of anonymization is very similar to the one practiced by the Demographic Health Surveys project. All respondents within a cluster share the same coordinates. Cluster centers were initially calculated by averaging all longitudes and latitudes, then displacing the point randomly within a radius inside the second-level geographic area (e.g. counties). The maximum radius for displacement is within 2km for an urban area and 5km for a rural area, with a 1/100 chance of the maximum rural radius being 10km. This method is intended to preserve location anonymity while still being usable for basic spatial analysis purposes. Due to inadequate data, 2013 GPS data for Nigeria and Tanzania are unavailable.
